
This thermal model has been developed incledes ion sputtering and photon desorption and it's based on thermal calculation includes the orbit radius, rotation periode and heat conduction.
We use Monte Carlo method to choose the sputtered molecules's kinetics of ballistic motion heated by surface temperature, and as knowing
